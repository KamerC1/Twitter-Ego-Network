# Analysis of User Ego Networks on Twitter during the COVID-19 Lockdown
The goal of the project is to analyze the ego networks of Twitter users in order to explore the impact of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on online social relationships.

The project consists of several stages. Initially, Twitter's APIs were utilized to collect a significant volume of tweets from March 2015 to March 2022. Based on the collected tweets, ego networks of selected users were constructed. Subsequently, we analyzed the intensity of interactions within these ego networks, considering metrics such as the number of exchanged tweets, retweets, mentions, and replies. Finally, cluster analysis methods were applied to identify and study the subgroups present within the ego networks.
